            The highly successful Cedarville University Solar Boat Team is teaming up with SeaLandAire

            Technologies to take the next step in accepting the

            Cedarville University is fresh off its 8th

            <a target="_blank" href="http://solarsplash.com/">Solar Splash World Championship</a>

            and is eager to return

            to the Dutch Solar Challenge in the Netherlands where in 2012 Cedarville was the top university

            team finishing ahead of all other schools while taking a 3rd place overall in the Top Class.

            <a target="_blank" href="http://sealandaire.com/">SeaLandAire Technologies</a>, Inc.
            
            is a vibrant, innovative company that has created its reputation

            as a world-leader in hydrophone and sonobuoy research and development.  In addition to its

            expertise in underwater acoustics, SeaLandAire has also developed numerous prototype sensor

            

            platforms for both scientific and defense applications, including: unattended ground sensors,

            unmanned air vehicles, high speed unmanned surface vessels, persistent station keeping buoys,

            and unmanned underwater vehicles (one of which uses propellers designed and manufactured by

            the Cedarville boat team).  Two important alumni of Cedarville University’s Solar Boat Team

            are now key members of SeaLandAire’s engineering development team.

            The 2016 Dutch Solar Challenge, with over 30 boats participating from 9 different countries,

            will, for the first time, start in Amsterdam.  The race will then proceed through the canals and

            lakes of Friesland, and will end in Leeuwarden, home of the great Elfstedentocht, a famous ice

            skating race around the province. The 2012 race, Cedarville’s most recent appearance, was a

            challenge in perseverance as rain continually hampered the event and forced teams to be

            especially diligent in the management of energy. The Cedarville team was the only team from

            the US and, in addition to defeating the university teams from Europe, Cedarville also beat teams

            from Brazil, Turkey, and China. Only two boats finished ahead of Cedarville. These boats, out of

            the same mold and sponsored by Clafis/Private Energy, were impressive in their performance

            and set a standard for other boats to strive to achieve. TU Delft, multiple winner of the

            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/">World Solar Challenge (Australia)</a>

            and the Dutch Solar Challenge is always a strong, innovative

            contender, as is the Midnight Sun boat of KYAMK University in Finland.

            Since 2014, Cedarville has had the privilege and responsibility of hosting the Solar Splash in

            Eastwood MetroPark, Dayton, Ohio.  The “City of Inventions” is a fitting venue for this

            innovative competition; as early as 1900, Dayton had the highest number of patents per capita,

            and when one searches for “Dayton Inventions,” one finds long lists of famous inventions that

            are always cited as being a small sample of the many.  The Wright Brothers were based here and

            minutes away from the Eastwood MetroPark are numerous aviation landmarks. Nearby Huffman

            Prairie is where the Wright Brothers spent years improving their plane, and is home to a replica

            of their hangar and launch system, which are open to public viewing. The National Museum of

            the United States Air Force, less than a mile away and free to the public, hosts over a million

            visitors per year.

            Eastwood Lake, formerly known as the Dayton Hydrobowl, was once a major race venue for

            Thunderboat racing. Some of the fastest boats in the world (e.g. Miss Budweiser, Miss Madison,

            Oh Boy Oberto, etc.) raced here. Dayton’s history of invention and boat racing make this an

            ideal site for the Solar Splash.

            None of the success of the Cedarville University Solar Boat Team would be possible without the

            grace of God; we are greatly blessed by a generous team of supporters. Our success is a gift of

            God – but, when "it’s all been said and done," "you can take this whole world (and all its

            success), but give me Jesus."

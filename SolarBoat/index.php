        The Cedarville University Solar Boat Team is fresh off impressive performances both in the US and abroad. In July 2012, the Cedarville team was the <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Solar-Team-Make-Splash-in-Netherlands.aspx" target="_blank">top university team in the Dong Energy Solar Challenge (the Netherlands)</a> finishing ahead of all other university teams and taking a 3rd place overall in the Top Class. In 2013, Cedarville captured the <a href="http://www.solarsplash.com" target="_blank">Solar Splash World Championship of Collegiate Solar Boating</a>; this is Cedarville’s seventh championship in the past 10 years.</p>
        <p>The Dong Energy Solar Challenge, with over 40 boats participating, follows the 220 km course of the great Elfstedentocht, a famous ice skating race around the province of Friesland, the Netherlands. The course begins and ends in Leeuwarden, the capital city of Friesland,  and traverses the Frisian canals and lakes, passing through eleven cities. The 2012 race was a challenge in perseverance as rain continually hampered the event and forced teams to be especially diligent in the management of energy. The Cedarville team was the only team from the US and, in addition to defeating the university teams from Europe, Cedarville also beat teams from Brazil, Turkey, and China. Two boats, out of the same mold, finished ahead of Cedarville. These boats, sponsored by Private Energy, were impressive in their performance and set a standard for other boats to strive to achieve.</p>
        <p>In the rain-shortened Solar Splash 2013 competition, Cedarville took 1st place in the Endurance, Sprint, and Slalom, and 3rd in the Qualifier.  Cedarville also took 1st place in the Tech Report and 2nd in the Technical Display.</p>
        <p>Starting in 2014, Cedarville will host the Solar Splash in Dayton, Ohio.  This is a great opportunity for teams to visit Dayton, the City of Inventions.  The Wright Brothers were based here and minutes away from the race venue are numerous aviation landmarks.  Nearby Huffman Prairie is where the Wright Brothers spent years improving their plane, and a replica of their hanger and launch system are open to public viewing.  The National Museum of the United States Air Force, less than a mile away, hosts over a million visitors per year.</p>
        <p>Dayton was also once a major race venue for Thunderboat racing.  Some of the fastest boats in the world (e.g. Miss Budweiser, Miss Madison, Oh Boy Oberto, etc.) would compete in the Dayton Hydrobowl, now called Eastwood Lake, while on the race circuit.  Eastwood Lake in Eastwood Park is the venue for Solar Splash 2014.  Dayton’s history of invention and boat racing make this an ideal venue for Solar Splash.  Cedarville University’s Solar Boat Team has a proven track record of world-class status and we look forwarding to hosting this event. </p>
        <p>None of our success would be possible without the grace of God; we are greatly blessed by a great team of sponsors who have been extremely generous to us.   Our success is a gift of God, but when "it’s all been said and done," "you can take this whole world (and all its success), but give me Jesus."</p>

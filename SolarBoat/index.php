            The highly successful Cedarville University Solar Boat Team is teaming up with SeaLandAire
            Technologies to take the next step in accepting the

            Cedarville University is fresh off its 8th
            <a target="_blank" href="http://solarsplash.com/">Solar Splash World Championship</a>
            and is eager to return to the Dutch Solar Challenge in the Netherlands where in 2012 Cedarville
            was the top university team finishing ahead of all other schools while taking a 3rd place overall
            in the Top Class.

            The 2016 Dutch Solar Challenge, with over 30 boats participating from 9 different countries, will
            start in Amsterdam.  The race will then proceed through the canals and lakes of Friesland, and
            will end in Leeuwarden, home of the great Elfstedentocht, a famous ice skating race around the
            province. The 2012 race was a challenge in perseverance as rain continually hampered the event
            and forced teams to be especially diligent in the management of energy. The Cedarville team was
            the only team from the US and, in addition to defeating the university teams from Europe,
            Cedarville also beat teams from Brazil, Turkey, and China. Two boats, out of the same mold,
            finished ahead of Cedarville. These boats, sponsored by Clafis/Private Energy, were impressive
            in their performance and set a standard for other boats to strive to achieve. TU Delft, multiple
            winner of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/">World Solar Challenge (Australia)</a> 
            and the Dutch Solar Challenge is always a strong, innovative contender, as is the Midnight Sun
            boat of KYAMK University in Finland.

            Since 2014, Cedarville has hosted the Solar Splash in Dayton, Ohio, the City of Inventions. The
            Wright Brothers were based here and minutes away from the race venue are numerous aviation
            landmarks. Nearby Huffman Prairie is where the Wright Brothers spent years improving their
            plane, and a replica of their hanger and launch system are open to public viewing. The National
            Museum of the United States Air Force, less than a mile away, hosts over a million visitors per
            year.

            Eastwood Park, formerly known as the Dayton Hydrobowl, was also once a major race venue for
            Thunderboat racing. Some of the fastest boats in the world (e.g. Miss Budweiser, Miss Madison,
            Oh Boy Oberto, etc.) would compete at our race venue. Dayton’s history of invention and boat
            racing make this an ideal venue for Solar Splash.
            None of our success would be possible without the grace of God; we are greatly blessed by a
            great team of sponsors who have been extremely generous to us. Our success is a gift of God, but
            when "it’s all been said and done," "you can take this whole world (and all its success), but give
            me Jesus."
